    "Imagine a plot with utility of the true positive (uTP) on the x-axis, from 0 to 1. On the y-axis, weâ€™d have H/B with a reasonable logarithmic range. Since we established a way to translate Cfp/Cfn into H/B, we can get the optimal point on the ROC. For each pair of uTP and H/B, we can find the optimal point on the ROC that maximizes expected utility. That point gives us the pair of sensitivity and specificity. We use it to find the expected utility as well as pL and pU, the lower and upper priors between which the model has value. This would give us 3 plots. First plot shows the expected value; second plot shows the lowest prior for which the model has value; the third plot shows the highest prior for which the model has value.\n",
